Day-26

Life is constant uncertainty. The only certainty is death. Today's topic was List and Dictionary Comprehension in Python, which was wonderfully explained by Angela Yu

What did I learn?

List Comprehension

new_list=[new_item for new_item in list]
List Comprehension supports any sequence: list, range, string, tuple

Conditional list comprehension

new_list=[new_item for new_item in list if condition]
Dictionary comprehension

new_dict={new_key:new_value for (new_key,new_value) in dict.items() if condition}

Project of the day

NATO Alphabet using dictionary comprehension and Pandas library. You can check out my code. You can also clone and run on a local machine using an IDE.


Conclusion

To conclude, I would thank my instructor for being such a wonderful teacher and for coming up with a beautiful course. I would like to thank MYSELF for being self-motivated throughout the lecture.
